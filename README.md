We introduce a deep neural network model, called Simple Sequential Attention Network (SimSANet), which concurrently blends a sequential multi-kernel approach to achieve a trade-off between complexity and performance. This method reduces the computational load and adopts a faster approach while efficiently capturing essential information from feature maps of different scales, from local to global. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a variety of publicly accessible VMMR datasets, including Stanford Cars, Comprehensive Cars (CompCars), Comprehensive Cars Surveillance Nature (CompCarsSV), and the Vehicle Images dataset. The suggested approach performs better in the vehicle make and model recognition task than the most advanced models. With 94.47\% accuracy on Stanford Cars, 98.34\% on CompCars, 99.20\% on CompCarsSV, and 97.20\% on the Vehicle Images dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.
